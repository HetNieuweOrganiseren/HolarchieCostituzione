####Iâ€™m not technically savvy. How do I use GitHub to contribute my ideas to evolving Holacracy?

You can start by orienting yourself with these basic resources about Version (Revision) Control in Open Source development and GitHub basics. 

- http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Revision_control
- https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo
- https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests
- https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary

Additionally in the next couple of weeks/months we will be providing various tutorials and further FAQ support so that everyone can actively particpate in evolving the Holacracy model or pulling the code to remix for their own purposes. 

####Who can I contact about this platform?
